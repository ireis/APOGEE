Examples for using the data products from:

Detecting outliers and learning complex structures with large spectroscopic surveys â€“ a case study with APOGEE stars

https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/476/2/2117/4848309

The examples include:
1. Plotting the t-SNE maps that are shown in the paper
2. Given an APOGEE ID, retrive objects with similar spectra
3. Calculate a weirdness score
4. Select objects from the t-SNE map
